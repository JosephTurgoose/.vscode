# Overview

The task I set for myself in this project was to use C++, a new programming language to me, in order to create an inventory tracker.

The program is very simple.  It allows you to add or remove speicific items from a list or clear the list entirely, and when you are done it asks if you would like to save the inventory to a current file.

My purpose in writing this software is to test and get a feel for C++, as well as create a system that could accurately demonstrate the things I learned about it over the course of two weeks.

# Development Environment

The main places I went to learn what I needed about C++ were YouTube, for its many resources described in great detail, ChatGPT, for its ability to explain things quickly, and w3schools, for its simple and easily understandable explanations and examples of how to start the language and implement various methods and commands within it.

This project was done entirely in C++.  I included iostream and fstream, which are basic C++ method libraries, as well as the libraries for strings, lists, and windows.h, which is used for the Sleep() function.

# Future Work

- Allow for taking out 1 of a set of duplicate items from the list at a time.
- Register items as the same no matter the character cases.
- Send file data to a database over the web.
